Welcome to My Blog

I'm Socra, an undergraduate student at Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University, majoring in Chinese Language and Literature.

This blog currently focuses on my The Sharing Project of Literature School, which will be continuously updated until my graduation. I may add personal essays or reflections in the future.

I firmly believe that knowledge is a priceless treasure, and sharing it is the best way to amplify its value.

Wishing all visitors fruitful academic journeys!
